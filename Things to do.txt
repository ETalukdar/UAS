Things to Fix

1. The UAS should not navigate to the dropzone before delivering the payloads it should navigate to the
theoretical droppoint calculated from the wind speed and coordinates of the dropzone

2. When then using the image recognition for better targeting it must take account of the fact that the heading will
be differnt at the droppoint 

3. If the image recognition fails must release the payload at the calculated droppoint coordinates

4. Safety Script must end when main script ends

Things to Do

1. Take-off

2. Reposition after first payload release

3. Returning and repositioning for landing
